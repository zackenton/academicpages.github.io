I am currently a Research Assistant at the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI), University of Oxford, where I work in the technical AI Safety team, where I am advised by Owain Evans. In September 2018 I will start a Postdoc with Yarin Gal, in the Machine Learning group at the University of Oxford. My work focuses on technical AI safety, and at the moment I am most interested in safety issues around reinforcement learning, including robustness and safe exploration.

Prior to FHI, I was a Visiting Researcher at the University of Montreal, in the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA), where I worked with Yoshua Bengio and others on generalization in deep learning.

Before that I was briefly a Data Scientist at ASI Data Science, where I applied machine learning to a range of projects for various organisations. I built a recommendation system for a major supermarket, made predictive models for a political campaign and built donor engagement models for a breast cancer charity.

In 2017 I completed my PhD at Queen Mary University of London, where I studied Theoretical Physics. My PhD research was on the overlap of string theory and cosmology, focussing on the physics of the early universe, just after the big bang.

Before my PhD I studied for my Masters and Bachelors in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.

Outside of work I am interested in a range of social issues and I love to paint. I am involved in the Effective Altruism movement who also support my research. Message me if you want to get in touch.
