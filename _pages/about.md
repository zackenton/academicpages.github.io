I am a Postdoc at the University of Oxford, in the Oxford Applied and Theoretical Machine Learning (OATML) group, working under Yarin Gal. My primary research interest is technical AI safety, currently working on robustness and safe exploration in reinforcement learning. I was previously a Research Assistant under Owain Evans at the Future of Humanity Institute, University of Oxford and a Visiting Researcher at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA), under Yoshua Bengio. I also worked as a Data Scientist at ASI Data Science. I completed my PhD in 2017 at Queen Mary University of London in Theoretical Physics, where I worked on string theory and cosmology. Prior to my PhD, I studied Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.

Outside of work I am interested in a range of social issues and I love to paint. I am involved in the Effective Altruism movement who also support my research. Message me if you want to get in touch.
