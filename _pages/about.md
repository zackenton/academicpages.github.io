 I am a Research Scientist in AI safety at DeepMind, mainly interested in specification/alignment. I was previously a Postdoc at the University of Oxford, in the Oxford Applied and Theoretical Machine Learning (OATML) group, working under Yarin Gal. Prior to that I was a Research Assistant under Owain Evans at the Future of Humanity Institute, University of Oxford and a Visiting Researcher at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA), under Yoshua Bengio. I also worked as a Data Scientist at ASI Data Science. I completed my PhD in 2017 at Queen Mary University of London in Theoretical Physics, where I worked on string theory and cosmology. Prior to my PhD, I studied Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.

Outside of work I am interested in politics and climate change, and I love to paint. Message me if you want to get in touch.
